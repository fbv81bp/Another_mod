This morning I tried to understand the Montgomery modular reduction algorithm. Frankly put: I still don't succeed. But I invented this recursive modular division algorithm, that solely uses division and modulus of two's next power, while furthermore only multiplication and subtraction.

Then I found out it can easily be described in a loop too.

testing.txt is the output of loop_mod.py: it wasn't easy to find a test case, where the subtraction in the end needs to be performed.
